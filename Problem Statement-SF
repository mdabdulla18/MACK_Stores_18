📌 Business Context

MACK Stores operates as a fast-growing retail chain, serving thousands of customers daily across multiple outlets. With a wide product catalog ranging from groceries to household goods, the company faces challenges in delivering seamless customer experiences while managing large-scale operations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

❌ Challenges Faced

Scattered Customer Data – Customer information and loyalty details are not centralized, making it hard to track purchase history.

Manual Inventory Tracking – Stock updates across stores are manual, leading to frequent stockouts or overstocking.

Limited Customer Engagement – Promotions and offers are generic, not tailored to customer preferences.

Slow Decision-Making – Store managers and leadership lack real-time dashboards for sales and inventory performance.

Operational Inefficiency – No integrated system to connect sales, inventory, and customer loyalty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 Need for Salesforce CRM

MACK Stores requires a centralized Salesforce CRM system to:

Provide a 360° customer view (purchase history, loyalty points, engagement).

Automate loyalty point management and personalized promotions.

Track products, stock levels, and replenishments across all stores.

Capture orders & billing data from POS/online systems.

Deliver real-time reports & dashboards for sales, store performance, and customer insights.
